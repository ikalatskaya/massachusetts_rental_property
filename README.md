Hey,

I have been living in Massachusetts for five years and I am looking to buy a rental property here. Massachusetts is one of the most densely populated states in the US, beautiful with a lot of history and a lot of lovely places, the best universities in the world, ocean coastline and ~350 towns and cities. So, which town to choose? It is not a trivial question. It should be probably neither too small (only 75 people live in the smallest town in MA) nor Boston (with sky-rocketing prices). It should be with the decent percent of homeowners but not too high, shouldn't?

I have scraped, collected, cleaned the data from different resources. Let's see what we have got. 

# Massachusetts rental price and property cost visualization

## INTRODUCTION

This app consolidates rent prices in different towns and cities in Massachusetts, house prices and other relevant information. The main objective of the app is to prioritize towns in MA where house price and rent relationship is the most favorable for a potential investor.

## Dashboard tab

## Funnel tab

Funnel is a pipe that is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, usualy used for guiding liquid or powder into a small opening. I used this term to describe an opportunity to select small number of MA towns out of ~350 in total using user's attributes like average property price range, population, etc. 

In the example below, we wanted to see a list of town in Middlesex county (close to Boston!) with buyer index between 10 and 20, population under 30,000 and price below $500,000.

Ayer, Shirley, Pepperell and Maynard are getting prioritized.

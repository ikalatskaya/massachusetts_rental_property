## Funnel Tab

Funnel is a pipe that is wide at the top and narrow at the bottom, usualy used for guiding liquid or powder into a small opening. I used this term to describe an opportunity to select small number of MA towns out of ~350 in total using user's attributes like average property price range, population, etc. 

In the example below, we wanted to see a list of town in Middlesex county (close to Boston!) with buyer index between 10 and 20, population under 30,000 and price below $500,000.
